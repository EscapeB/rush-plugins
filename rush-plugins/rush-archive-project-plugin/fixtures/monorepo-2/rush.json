   * (Required) This specifies the version of the Rush engine to be used in this repo.
   * Rush's "version selector" feature ensures that the globally installed tool will
   * behave like this release, regardless of which version is installed globally.
   *
   * The common/scripts/install-run-rush.js automation script also uses this version.
   *
   * NOTE: If you upgrade to a new major version of Rush, you should replace the "v5"
   * path segment in the "$schema" field for all your Rush config files.  This will ensure
   * correct error-underlining and tab-completion for editors such as VS Code.
